            Uyghur meat pie, or Gosh Naan, is like a stuffed naan that's fried 
            to crispy, flaky, and buttery perfection on the outside, while the 
            inside remains juicy and full of flavor. The rich fat from the lamb 
            soaks into the dough as it fries, creating an incredibly satisfying 
            texture and taste. Slice it into triangles and serve with chili oil 
            for an extra burst of heat, and you're in for one of the most 
            delicious experiences!

        <h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
        <h4>THE DOUGH</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cups warm water</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>THE MEAT FILLING</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound ground lamb</li>
            <li>1/2 yellow onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt, to taste</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper, to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>OTHER</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>vegetable oil, for frying</li>
            <li>chili oil, for serving</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>Prepare the Dough:</b> In a large bowl, mix the flour, salt, 
                and active dry yeast. Gradually add the warm water and oil, 
                stirring until the mixture forms a dough. Knead the dough for 
                about 5 to 6 minutes until smooth and elastic. Cover the bowl 
                with plastic wrap and a damp cloth and let it rest in a warm 
                place for 1 hour or until it doubles in size.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <b>Prepare the Filling:</b> In a separate bowl, combine the 
                ground lamb, finely chopped onion, salt, black pepper, cumin, 
                paprika, garlic powder, and chili powder. Mix everything 
                together thoroughly. The filling will remain raw and will cook 
                during the frying process.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <b>Form the Naan:</b> Once the dough has risen, punch it down 
                and divide it into four equal sections. Flatten each section 
                into a circle or oval shape on a lightly floured surface. Spread 
                the lamb filling over two of the flattened dough sections, 
                leaving a small border around the edges. Take the other two 
                flattened dough pieces and place them on top of the filled ones, 
                covering the meat mixture. Press down lightly to seal.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <b>Pinched Design:</b> Carefully fold the edges of the dough 
                over the filling, creating a pinched design like a pie crust. 
                Make sure to seal the sides tightly so the filling doesnâ€™t 
                escape during frying.
            </li> 
            <br>
            <li>
                <b>Fry the Naan:</b> Heat vegetable oil in a deep pan or skillet 
                over medium-high heat. Once the oil is hot, carefully lower the 
                stuffed naan into the oil. Fry on both sides for about 3-4 
                minutes per side, or until golden brown and crispy. Ensure the 
                meat is cooked through and the center is fully cooked.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <b>Slice and Serve:</b> Once fried, remove the naans from the 
                oil and drain on paper towels. Slice into triangles, like a 
                pizza, and serve warm. For an extra kick, drizzle with chili oil 
                on top and enjoy!
