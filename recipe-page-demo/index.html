            Uyghur meat pie, or Gosh Naan, is like a stuffed naan that's fried 
            to crispy, flaky, and buttery perfection on the outside, while the 
            inside remains juicy and full of flavor. The rich fat from the lamb 
            soaks into the dough as it fries, creating an incredibly satisfying 
            texture and taste. Slice it into triangles and serve with chili oil 
            for an extra burst of heat, and you're in for one of the most 
            delicious experiences!
