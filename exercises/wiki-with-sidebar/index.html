                Oaxaca,<sup>[a]</sup> officially the Free and Sovereign State of 
                Oaxaca, <sup>[b]</sup> is one of the 32 states that compose the 
                Federative Entities of the United Mexican States. It is divided 
                into 570 municipalities, of which 418 
                <i>(almost three quarters)</i> are governed by the system of 
                usos y costumbres (customs and traditions)<sup>[8]</sup> with 
                recognized local forms of self-governance. Its capital city is 
                Oaxaca de Juárez.
            </p>
            <p>
                Oaxaca is in southern Mexico.<sup>[9]</sup> It is bordered by 
                the states of Guerrero to the west, Puebla to the northwest, 
                Veracruz to the north, and Chiapas to the east. To the south, 
                Oaxaca has a significant coastline on the Pacific Ocean.
            </p>
            <p>
                The state is best known for its indigenous peoples and cultures. 
                The most numerous and best known are the Zapotecs and the 
                Mixtecs, but 16 are officially recognized. These cultures have 
                survived better than most others in Mexico due to the state's 
                rugged and isolating terrain. Most live in the Central Valleys 
                region, which is also an economically important area for 
                tourism, with people attracted for its archeological sites such 
                as Monte Albán, and Mitla,[10] and its various native cultures 
                and crafts. Another important tourist area is the coast, which 
                has the major resort of Huatulco and sandy beaches of Puerto 
                Escondido, Puerto Ángel, Zipolite, Bahia de Tembo, and Mazunte.
                [11] Oaxaca is also one of Mexico's most biologically diverse 
                states, ranking in the top three, along with Chiapas and 
                Veracruz, for numbers of reptiles, amphibians, mammals and 
                plants.[12]

                Oaxaca is a region known for its long and complex history, 
                deeply rooted in the cultures of its indigenous peoples and the 
                interactions with various conquering empires.
            </p>
            <h4>Early History</h4>
            <p>
                Human habitation in Oaxaca dates back to roughly 11,000 BCE, 
                with evidence of early agriculture and the domestication of 
                plants found in the Guilá Naquitz cave. The region was home to 
                several indigenous cultures, with the Zapotec and Mixtec being 
                the most prominent.
                The Zapotecs established a powerful civilization with Monte 
                Albán serving as a major center from 500 BCE to 750 CE.
                The Mixtecs later rose to prominence and exerted influence over 
                the region, taking control of Monte Albán in 1325.
            </p>   
            <h4>Aztec & Spanish Arrival</h4>
                <p>
                The Aztecs arrived in Oaxaca around 1250 AD and established 
                military outposts, extending their control in the 15th 
                century.Following the fall of the Aztec capital, Tenochtitlan, 
                the Spanish arrived in Oaxaca in 1521, drawn by reports of gold. 
                <br>Cortés's captains, like Gonzalo de Sandoval and Francisco de 
                Orozco, played a role in the Spanish conquest of the area.
                The Spanish established a settlement in the Central Valley, 
                originally known as Guajaca, and later Antequera de Guaxaca, 
                now Oaxaca de Juárez. The Spanish colonization had a devastating 
                impact on the native population due to disease and forced labor.
                </p>
            <h4>Colonial Period & Independence</h4>
            <p>
                During the colonial era, Oaxaca prospered from the export of 
                cochineal dye and textiles. Oaxaca remained loyal to the Spanish 
                Crown during the initial stages of the Mexican War of 
                Independence. However, insurgent forces gained ground, and the 
                state played a role in the independence struggle, finally 
                becoming a state in 1824.

                <p>
                    Located in southern Mexico, features a diverse climate. 
                    While it generally has a tropical savanna climate, 
                    categorized as Aw under the Köppen climate classification, 
                    its varied topography influences local weather patterns. The 
                    coastal areas experience warm temperatures and high humidity 
                    year-round. Inland areas, like Oaxaca City, have a more 
                    temperate climate with distinct wet and dry seasons. The 
                    rainy season typically runs from May to October, with 
                    afternoon showers and occasional thunderstorms being common. 
                    The dry season, from October to April, offers sunny days, 
                    low humidity, and cooler nights, making it a popular time to 
                    visit. Overall, Oaxaca provides a pleasant climate with 
                    consistent warmth, but visitors should be prepared for 
                    regional variations, especially considering the higher 
                    elevations which can be significantly cooler.

                    Oaxaca's tourism scene today is experiencing significant 
                    growth, fueled by its unique blend of ancient indigenous 
                    culture and colonial charm, coupled with a focus on 
                    sustainable and authentic experiences. The city and 
                    surrounding areas are popular for their historical sites 
                    like Monte Albán and Mitla, vibrant markets, incredible 
                    food, and renowned mezcal production. However, this tourism 
                    boom also presents challenges, including rising housing 
                    prices and gentrification, which have led to tensions with 
                    the local population. Despite these issues, Oaxaca continues 
                    to attract a diverse range of visitors, including both 
                    domestic and international travelers, drawn to its cultural 
                    richness and immersive experiences.
